# Pillager Indicator

A very simple addon which shows a UI overlay and plays a sound if the player received the Pillager's Profit buff. While wearing Pillager this addon should not do anything, it was made to show group members if they get the ultimate from it.

It was made to be as little intrusive as possible, so there will most likely not be a cooldown or similar until I figure out how to show this without putting a huge icon on the screen.

## Settings
- Enable Addon
- Change color / opacity
- Change Sound on buff start
- Test your settings
